"Jarren Duran leads the way for Beat The Streak players today, setting the table at Fenway with a strong track record against righties and a park boost to back him up. Duran’s consistency—hitting safely in over 60% of games—pairs well with a soft matchup against Chris Paddack, making him the top pick for extending any streak. Jeremy Peña is right behind, riding a steady season and recent hot stretch, plus a favorable spot atop the lineup against a hittable lefty. Brendan Donovan and Bobby Witt Jr. both offer reliability and a platoon edge, but Duran and Peña stand out for their blend of matchup, form, and streak potential."
