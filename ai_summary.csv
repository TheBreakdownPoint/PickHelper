"Brendan Donovan leads the Beat The Streak board with a strong blend of recent form and season-long steadiness, hitting safely in over 63% of games and riding a recent uptick at the plate. He draws a favorable platoon edge against Jameson Taillon, who’s been hittable lately, and gets a slight park boost—ideal for streak chasers looking for reliability up top. Xavier Edwards sits just behind, offering consistency all year and a soft matchup at home with a park that’s been hitter-friendly, though his recent cold spell is worth noting. Jeremy Peña and Heliot Ramos round out the top options, both benefiting from lineup position and favorable matchups, but Donovan’s combination of hot streak and matchup makes him the clear pick for extending a streak tonight."
