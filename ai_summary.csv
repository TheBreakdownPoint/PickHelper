"Bryce Harper headlines today's Beat The Streak picks with a strong platoon edge at home and a track record of consistency, reaching base in over 61% of his games this season. He draws Janson Junk, who's been hit hard lately, making Harper a reliable anchor for any streak. Alec Bohm is right behind, riding a hot stretch at the plate and quietly delivering hits in nearly 70% of his gamesâ€”his steady approach and favorable home setting keep the floor high. Kyle Schwarber also benefits from the lefty matchup and park boost, while Jarren Duran and Yandy Diaz round out the list with solid trends and advantageous spots. For streak chasers, Harper and Bohm stand out as the safest bets to keep the run alive."
