"Brendan Donovan leads the pack for Beat The Streak players, setting the table atop San Francisco’s lineup with a strong track record of consistency and a clear platoon edge against Justin Verlander. Donovan’s hit rate has been steady all year, and he’s reached base safely in over 63% of his games, making him a reliable anchor for any streak. Alec Burleson isn’t far behind, swinging a hot bat lately and thriving in the same favorable matchup, with his recent surge pushing his hit rate even higher. For those looking to round out their picks, Jurickson Profar gets a slight park boost at home and Luis Arraez remains one of the most dependable contact hitters in the game, both offering solid streak potential. Stick with Donovan up top for the best blend of consistency and matchup upside."
