"Bobby Witt Jr. leads the slate with a strong track record for Beat The Streak players—he’s hit safely in over three-quarters of his games this year and brings a clear platoon edge against Kikuchi, who’s been hittable by righties all season. Witt’s consistency stands out, making him the top pick for extending any streak tonight. Shohei Ohtani follows closely, riding a steady season and a favorable lefty-vs-righty matchup against Nelson, with a slight park boost adding to his appeal. Chandler Simpson and Steven Kwan also profile as reliable options, each benefitting from soft matchups and recent steady production. For those looking to keep their streak alive, Witt Jr. is the name to trust."
