"Jarren Duran leads the way for Beat The Streak players tonight, setting up shop at Fenway with a strong platoon advantage and a park factor that gives hitters an extra edge. Duran’s been steady all season with hits in over 61% of his games, and his leadoff spot against Casey Mize—who’s allowed a healthy rate of hits to lefties—makes him a prime pick for extending any streak. Brendan Donovan isn’t far behind, riding a quietly consistent year and drawing a soft matchup with Colin Rea while also benefiting from the top of the order and a favorable lefty-righty split. Xavier Edwards and Steven Kwan both offer reliable contact skills and recent momentum, rounding out a slate packed with high-floor options for streak chasers."
